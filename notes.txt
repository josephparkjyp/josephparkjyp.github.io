        <h2>From Python Beginner to Aspiring Web Developer: My Journey in Coding</h2>
        <p>My coding journey began during my university studies, 
            where I first learned the basics of Python. I was 
            fascinated by the power of programming and soon found 
            myself using it for data analysis. However, it was 
            during my clinical work in ABA that I discovered the 
            world of web development and fell in love with its 
            creative possibilities. Driven by my newfound passion, 
            I set out on a self-taught journey to further develop 
            my skills, expanding my knowledge to include various 
            coding languages and honing my web development abilities. 
            Now, I aspire to join a dynamic team of developers, 
            where I can continue to grow my skills, collaborate with 
            others, and bring my ideas to life through the creation 
            of innovative web applications.</p>
